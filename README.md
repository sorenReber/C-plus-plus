# Overview


In this repository are a standard basic Hello World. Pong clone built using Raylib from a tutorial but modified to make use of classes and OOP. Battleship game played in the console.

I created these programs in this repository to learn how to create programs in C++. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Future improvement: Pong: Add scores. Maybe even ability to track a high score.
* Future change: Battleship: Move from a console based interaction to one making use of Raylib.
* Future work: Come up with more programs to help develop my C++ skills. Maybe some non game programs although the games are fun to work on.
