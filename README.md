# Overview


In this repository are a standard basic Hello World. 2 PlayerPong clone built using Raylib from a tutorial but modified to make use of classes and OOP. Uses W & S for one side and the up & down arrows for the other, r resets the ball after someone wins. Battleship game played in the console.

I created these programs in this repository to learn how to create programs in C++. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* Future improvement: Pong: Add scores. Maybe even ability to track a high score. Make it single player by implementing simple bot movements and be able to choose one or two player.
* Future change: Battleship: Move from a console based interaction to one making use of Raylib, include sprites, sounds, and generally more interactive.
* Future work: Come up with more programs to help develop my C++ skills. Maybe some non game programs although the games are fun to work on.
